# shell32.dll Windows 7 ICO Files

This folder contains ICO files for the dll file. This is typically recommended for developers to download this. You can download as many images as you want. I only managed to make these icons thanks to [Help4Windows](https://help4windows.com) and their free shell32.dll download and icon download. All icons in here are 32x32 in size.
