# Windows 7 Icons

This folder contains icons from the Microsoft Operating System Windows 7. These images are all free to use, share and republish. It would help if you mentioned the IconHub project as it could get more people working on it.

## Icon Packs

Here is currently how many icon packs we have.

- shell32.dll
- imageres.dll

We're currently working to feature more icon packs so you can have more icons to use.

## How to use an icon pack?

Inside each folder there will be some instuctions on how to use it. 

## Why should I download these?

The icons in the ICO files folder in each icon pack is a great tool for developers to add icon packs to their projects and the DLL files is good to give a file/shortcut a custom look and feel.

## What operating systems do these work on?

The DLL files should work on Windows XP+ and the ICO files are widely supported across operating systems so you shouldn't have to worry about them.

## Are these a secure download?

Yes these files are a secure download and if you are security concious you can do a virus scan on Google-owned [VirusTotal](https://virustotal.com).

## Will my normal icon packs stop working after I download this?

Your normal icon packs located in C:\Windows\System32 will still work perfectly fine, if you have no idea what DLL's have icons in them do a Google search about it with your operating system name (e.g. what dlls have icons in them in Windows 8.1?).
